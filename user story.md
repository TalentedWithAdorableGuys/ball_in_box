## user stories
r is the radius of a circle while mu is the position of the center of the circle
A user can find the optimal value of r and mu which maximizes and sum r^2. 

 1. A user can get a limited box bounded by [-1,1] by entering the numbers , position of small blocks and the number of ballons.
 2. A user can obtain the maximum balloon radius(r) and position(mu)  that do not overlap with these blocks.
 3. A user can view the sum of squares of the variable radius.
